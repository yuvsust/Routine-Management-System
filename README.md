# Routine Management System

This project generates optimal schedules through
1. Sending out 2D routine (day vs time) to each professors with each one of them can fill their preference slot and venue on every single cell multiple times.
2. After recieving all the suggestions, it prioritizes the preference based on teacher's designation priority and venue availability.
3. Sends the final routine to each one of the professors with each cell showing classes which only he/she has.
4. Recieves feedback from the professors for modifications through various communication services.
